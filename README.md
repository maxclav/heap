# Heap in Go

Simple Heap where nodes have int as values.  
For learning purposes only.  
Please, use the [container/heap package of the Standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/container/heap) in your projects.  
## Commands

- `make` or `make help`: display all commands
- `make run-lint`: run linter
- `make run-tests`: unit tests not completed
- `make example`: run example

## Ideas

- Make one struct only with a type ("min" or "max")
